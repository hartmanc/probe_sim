# Buttonwillow evidence manifest (round 0: sources and stage 1, 20 Oct 2026)

Status: **stage 0 complete, stage 1 stopped at its fit gates** (no package, nothing published, no scenery placed). The
build-track skill's fitted-edge gates assume a painted edge line; Buttonwillow has none (see "Stage 1" below). Every
object table of a scenery round starts empty here: no object without a cited source, and no object yet.

| Cal Club Rd | not used | too far from the track to read anything on it |

## Eye-level inventory (stage 0.6-0.10)

`inventory.json` / `inventory.md` (generated by `inventory.py --pkg tools/track/out/buttonwillow`, i.e. mapped onto the
stage-1 diagnostic candidate, since no package is published): 59 lap frames between the start/finish crossings
(0:05.47-2:32.95), **92 rows**: kerb 37 (left 18, right 19), cone_line 16, wall 14, station 14, paint 4, building 3,
runoff 2, tyre_wall 1, mast 1; 13 of them pit-lane rows (`inventory/pit.jsonl`). Heights: 32 rows carry one, every one
with a method (jersey-ref 0.81 m for the K-rail pit and paddock walls, cone-ref, storeys for the tower); station heights
are not measured yet.

Time map (`inventory/source.json`): the start/finish crossings from the Catalyst lap timer, 15 GPS anchors every 10 s
from the Catalyst minimap dot (`tools/track/inventory/catalyst_dots.py`, fit p95 6.6 m), and the T2 and T9 speed minima.
Leave-one-out residuals 1.6-29.5 m with the speed profile (5-56 m linear); speeds in/out 21-41 m/s.

What the lap shows (for the scenery round): an open desert circuit, dirt runoff everywhere; one wall on the lap, the
white / red K-rail pit wall along the front straight, with a second K-rail between the pit lane and the paddock; flat
red / white / blue painted concrete kerbs (blocks ~1.0 m, band ~0.9 m beyond the asphalt edge; colour order blue,
white, red, white) at almost every corner; roofed corner stations on tyre-faced earth mounds; single orange cones at
turn-in points; the two-storey control tower with a blue roof and the scaffold starter's stand on the pit wall; a tall
communications mast north of T9 (OSM node 10220517717).

## Scans examined

| scan | captures | result |
|---|---|---|
| kerb blocks (compare/kerb_detect.py on the run-3 candidate) | all 106 | 41 candidate runs, 31 used as edge features (outer limit >= 0.3 m beyond the asphalt end, >= 9 m); colour reads "grey" on the captures (the onboard shows red / white / blue) |
| road mouths (OSM ways leaving the road, ray test) | - | 17 mouths besides the pit lane; prior interpolated across each (config `prior.interp`) |
| edge contrast (R, G, B across the edge at six stations) | c20_s0750, s1150, s1600, s2300, s2700, s4100 | asphalt R - B +8..+12, dirt +20..+31, luminance 140-160 on both sides: a 5-15 step in brightness, the outer 1-1.5 m of asphalt dusty |

## Stage 1: why it stopped

Five geometry runs (20 Oct 2026; `build_track.py --stage geometry`, the last two with `--write-on-fail` for diagnosis):

| run | edge evidence | coverage L / R | obs within 0.25 m L / R | other failures |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2 | default (painted lines) | 15 / 13 % | 93 / 91 % | gaps of 554 / 479 stations: no painted line to find |
| 3 | asphalt_end everywhere | 44 / 46 % | 77 / 81 % | waviness, kinks at the T1 and T11 kerbs, edge steps |
| 5 | asphalt_end tuned (jump 8, sat 40, -2..+2 m) + kerb_band at 31 kerb zones + prior across 17 mouths | 48 / 50 % | 75 / 78 % | waviness 0.046 / 0.050 m, edge steps 0.16-0.19 m at the pit-in (s ~4510), Sunset width collapsing to 4.9 m at the pit-in split |

Gates that pass in run 5: longest gap, painted-midpoint residual, loop stations, elevation range (3.3 m), direction,
start/finish (0.79 m), edge jumps, cross slope (max 9.7 %), world continuity, profile (max step 0.023 m); centre
converged after 30 refits; length 4697 m; corners T1 R 52, T2 26, T3 41, T4 40, T5 43, T6 88, T7 111, T8 68, T9 33,
T10 66, T11 46 m.

The blocker is the fit gates' measure, not a missing source: the fitted method's evidence is the painted line (12 cm,
sharp) and the red kerb band. Buttonwillow has neither: its asphalt ends in a ragged, dusty edge whose position varies
0.3-1.2 m station to station on the captures (the miss distribution in run 5 is flat from 0.25 to 1.2 m:
1006 / 738 / 667 / 635 / 500 rows), and its kerbs read grey. A warmth-step detector (R - B) finds the dust line
1.2-1.6 m inside the asphalt end (and would make the road ~11 m wide, under the operator's 36 ft minimum). The 90 %
within 0.25 m and 60 % coverage gates cannot be met from these captures without loosening them, which the skill
forbids. Options for the owner:

1. A gate definition for unpainted asphalt-to-dirt edges (an owner decision, written into the skill): e.g. the
   observation tolerance and coverage measured only on painted / kerb evidence, with asphalt-end sides held to the
   waviness, kink and edge-gate checks (which run 5 nearly passes) plus a whole-lap hood sheet review.
2. A sharper edge source: the 2021 lidar's intensity (18 pts/m^2; asphalt dark, dirt bright; a first 0.25 m raster
   at s ~2600 shows the road as a dark band with diffuse edges, so a 0.5 m grid at best), or licensed higher-resolution
   imagery.
3. Accept the NAIP-derived edges (13.0-13.7 m median width, inside the operator's 36-55 ft) as a provisional
   geometry for driving, clearly marked as not passing stage 1.

Builder changes made for this circuit (config-gated; Laguna's and Sonoma's code paths unchanged: their OSM loops and
the default asphalt_end are identical to the 1e71ef2 code on their caches and on 3000 random profiles): OSM way parts
driven against node order (`geo.osm_loop`), edge features `warm_end` and `kerb_band`, the asphalt_end detector's
parameters (`spline.asphalt_end`), `inventory.py --pkg`, and the app's three-colour kerb paint (`colors: [stripe,
base, stripe 2]`).
